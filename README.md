# ImpossibleLevelList

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.0.

# Impossible Level List Full-stack app
*Impossible Level List full stack repo for our favorite GD impossible level enjoyers*

# Introduction
I am MateussDev. You may know me for making Noclipped or building some levels in Geometry Dash, like Madness by me and sequoia
Here I decided to be more useful to the ILL community, so I started the development of the website version of the Impossible Level List

This list should be a simple excercise for making database-driven web apps similar to Pointercrate, but with my own twists and ticks

Progress coming soon! :)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
